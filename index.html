            <h3>What Is Programming Languages ?</h3>
            <p>A programming language is a formal
              language comprising a set of
              instructions that produce various kinds
              of output. Programming languages are
              used in computer programming to
              implement algorithms.
              </p>
              <p>Most programming languages consist of
                instructions for computers. There are
                programmable machines that use a set
                of specific instructions, rather than
                general programming languages. Early
                ones preceded the invention of the
                digital computer, the first probably
                being the automatic flute player
                described in the 9th century by the
                brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the
                Islamic Golden Age.
                <br> Since the early
                1800s, programs have been used to
                direct the behavior of machines such as
                Jacquard looms, music boxes and player
                pianos.
                <br> The programs for these
                machines (such as a player piano's
                scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.

            <h3>Definition of programming languages</h3>
            <p>A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or
                algorithm.
                Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all
                possible algorithms. Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language
                include:

          <div class="row mt-3">
            <h3>Story "Hello World!"</h3>
            <p>A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!".<br>
               Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language.<br>
                It is often the first program written by people learning to code. <br>It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
